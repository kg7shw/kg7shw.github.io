                <h2>Our story</h2>
                <p>Growing up my parents always emphasized the fact that we were their princesses. We had the potential to become something great. They reminded us that we should be looking for a husband one day that would treat us like a princess and someday a queen. 
                    Almost every little girl dreams of being a princess. They want to feel beautiful and special. I want to help them feel that. These dresses, crowns, aprons, and so forth provide a way for them to feel that they are a princess. They are able to dress like a princess in play and helping around the house. They can feel like Cinderella while doing their chores, or Bell as they do their reading for school. These dresses are not the Disney dresses as you notice, this is because I want these little princesses to know that they are their own princess. They do not have to be Cinderella, Snow White, or Elsa to be a princess, they are already one. They can choose their own royal dress, design their own appearance and be their own princess. They are special and have the potential to do whatever they dream of. They can be whoever they want to be.</p>
